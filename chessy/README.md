## General Info  
**Chessy** is a cyberpunk-themed chess game developed as a Python project. Inspired by our group's  passion for chess and modern design aesthetics, this game combines traditional gameplay with futuristic elements like sound effects, animations, and a sleek user interface.  

The game offers two modes: **Play with a Friend** and **Play with the Computer (AI)**. It also features a **Learn Section** to explore famous chess openings and a **Settings Menu** to customize sound options.  

### Inspiration  
This project was influenced by tutorials and ideas from developers like Eddie Sharick, along with my personal vision for a unique chess experience.
